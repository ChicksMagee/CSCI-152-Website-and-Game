# Aeviternus
CSCI 152 Project 
You can find our class/use case/sequence diagrams under the diagrams folder and can view all of the website files in the main Aeviternus Folder at the top and drill down to the python code if you want. (There is a lot there that was student created)
The only powerpoint presentation we have is from last year because we wanted more time to do actual demo and talk baout source code.
We have two different Wikis one for the game and one for the website.
The custom made menu code can be found in the js folder.
